    <h1>CSS Switch Demo</h1>
    <p>This piece of UI is not conventional on the web. iPhone introduced it to the world and now it seems accepted and understood by most web and mobile users. So perhaps it's safe to use it on the web?</p>
    <h2>iOS 7 style</h2>
    <p>The background and the button change effect are not implemented. I don't know how to do it yet. Tested on latest Firefox and Chrome on Mac only.</p>
